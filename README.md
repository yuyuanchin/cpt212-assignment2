# CPT212 Assignment 2: Boyer-Moore Algorithm
This repository contains the implementation of the Boyer-Moore string searching algorithm in C++, created for Assignment 2 of CPT212.

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a powerful string searching technique known for its efficiency in searching for a pattern within a text. It preprocesses the pattern to skip comparisons based on a set of heuristics, making it faster than naive methods.
